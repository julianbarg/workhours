The idea:
	Define a command that adds the timestamp for starting a task, and 
	one for stopping. Assumes that the repository is saved to the home
	directory	.



Common command line commands:

-touch file.txt: create text file file.txt.
-man: help function.
-echo "foo" >> file.txt
	Appends foo to the file file.txt.



Custom functions:
	Add to ~/.bashrc to save permanently.

-start_job: Save timestamp of starting work on project.
	Defined as:
	```
	function start_job () {
echo "${1},1,$(date -Iminutes)" >> ~/workhours/timestamps.csv
tail -1 ~/workhours/timestamps.csv
	}
	```

-end_job: Save timestamp of starting work on project.
	Defined as:
	```
	function end_job () {
job="$(tail -1 ~/workhours/timestamps.csv | grep -o -P '^[^,]*')"
echo "$job,0,$(date -Iminutes)" >> ~/workhours/timestamps.csv
tail -2 ~/workhours/timestamps.csv
	}
	```

-check_job: Check status of current job.
	Defined as:
	```
		function check_job {
tail -1 ~/workhours/timestamps.csv
}
	```

-pretty_csv file.csv: Pretty prints file.csv.
	Defined as:
	```
	function pretty_csv {
column -t -s, -n "$@" | less -F -S -X -K
	}
	```
